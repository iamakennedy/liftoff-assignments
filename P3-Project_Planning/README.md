# Lokker_App
LiftOff Personal project for LaunchCode

# Overview
My project will be an application that allows users to reserve secure, self-service storage lockers. The lockers will be stocked with appropriate exercise clothing and accessories, which will be determined by the user, at a time and place that is convenient for them. 
I decided to make this project because while I enjoy exercising, I found myself wanting solutions to a myriad of problems associated with exercising outside the home. 
*	 Carrying (and subsequently, forgetting) a gym bag
*	 Wanting appropriate clothing for your shape 
*	 Wanting appropriate clothing for new or frequently changing exercise habits
*	 Traveling professionals
